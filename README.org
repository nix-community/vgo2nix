* vgo2nix

Convert =go.mod= files to nixpkgs =buildGoPackage= compatible =deps.nix= files

** Installation

You can install the most recent vgo2nix by executing

#+begin_src
nix-env -i vgo2nix-git -f https://github.com/adisbladis/vgo2nix/archive/master.tar.gz
#+end_src

** Usage
From the go project directory execute
#+begin_src
vgo2nix
#+end_src

This will write a file called =deps.nix= that is to be used together with an expression like
#+begin_src nix
{ buildGoPackage, fetchFromGitHub }:
buildGoPackage rec {
  name = "vgo2nix-${version}";
  version = "example";
  goPackagePath = "...";  # Incomplete
  src = fetchFromGitHub { ... };  # Incomplete
  goDeps = ./deps.nix;
}
#+end_src

** Known issues

vgo2nix currently only supports git dependencies
